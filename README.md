# drumkit

Welcome to my first GitHub repository, which is related to my Flutter project for a Drumkit app! This project is a mobile application that simulates a drum kit on your phone or tablet, allowing you to play different drum sounds by tapping on the screen.

This repository contains all of the code, assets, and resources needed to build the Drumkit app, along with detailed documentation to help you get started. You'll find the Flutter source code, which includes the UI components, audio playback functionality, and user interaction logic.

Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute to this project as you see fit. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope this repository will inspire you to explore the possibilities of mobile app development with Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
